While the drama was sufficiently emotive and heartfelt, it's admirable that the jokes weren't sticking out like a sore thumb just for the sake of the need for some comedic vignettes."

With some cool and very gory death scenes, an all new cast, and the same creepy, death's coming to get you feel as the first two films. This turns out to be way better than i would have expected."

Paul Rudd is incredibly charming in the lead role with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña giving great supporting performances. The CG is great and the action sequences are extremely impressive. The humour works really well and it's consistently funny. Unfortunately, it does suffer from the weak villain problem that some other Marvel movies suffer from."
